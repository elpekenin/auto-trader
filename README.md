# auto-trader 
This project is going to be an auto trader script for Pok√©mon GO, using [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) to capture the phone's screen and clicking on it.
For now, it's going to be a 1Phone-With-2Apps feature, but I might implement a 2Phone version.
The idea is to input some information (username of bot accounts, name of the trading tags) and let the script do the rest while you do something else.
To avoid possible anti-bot system, it's going to use RNG for both timings and positions on where to click (inside the boundaries of the buttons)
